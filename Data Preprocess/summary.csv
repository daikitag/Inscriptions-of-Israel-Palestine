Ἀντισκινήσ(ας) is the aorist participle of ἀντι(σ)κινέω, ""move in opposition, against; disturb."" The upsilon preceding the word is a dialectical form of the article ὁ. Πάταξε is from πατάσσω, ""to strike, smite,"" and occurs frequently in the Septuagint for הכה. Αὐτοῦ is a grammatical mistake for αὐτόν. Ουρουν is probably a Greek transliteration of עורון (with ayin unexpressed; vav was normally expressed by ΟΥ). Greek transliterations of Hebrew words are found on other ossuaries in the area. The prohibition against opening the ossuary is like several other protective formulae presumably intended to protect the remains of the deceased and/or to prevent the mingling of his/her remains with others'. Specifically, curses and threats of retribution against trangressors occur in Greek inscriptions from Bet She'arim, Phrygian Jewish and Aramaic epitaphs.

Several spellings mistakes occur here: ἀδαλφού for ἀδελφοί; ὐού for υἰοί; Ἰαιέρε for Ἰαείρου/יאיר, a name occurring in the Septuagint, Josephus, and on further ossuaries; κυρε for κυροί/κυριοί, which can be read as the plural form of κύρος/κύριος based on the Aramaic inscription; τουπου for τόπου; and τυς for τοῦ(ς).

The left gable shows a three-petalled rosette within a three-quarter bead-and-reel circle, with a thin line at its base and slightly inclined lilies on left and right as side acroteria. A central acroterium above the circle seems to derive from a palmette; Watzinger described a similar palmette as ""caduceus-like."" The name Κυνωρός/קינרוס, probably a Greek approximation of the Semitic name כלב, also occurs on an ossuary that is presumably from the Hebron Hills. Διόδοτος is a common name in the Graeco-Roman world, also attested in a pagan context and at Masada. The contracted Aramaic form found on this lid remains unattested elsewhere. The term πρωτοπολείτης here corresponds to πρωτοπολίτης, ""first citizen,"" seeming to be the Greek term for a member of the honestiores under the Constitutia Antoniniana of 212 CE, and possibly referring in this case to a notable of nearby Eleutheropolis (founded after 200 CE). Yadin reads רשמרים as the Aramaic equivalent, contracted from רשעמרים, ""citizens,"" likely pronounced ""reshmarim."" (עמרים is derived from עמר, ""to dwell, reside."") Greek appears on the front side; Aramaic on the back.         "

The inscription is                    slightly broken in the middle and runs in a line across the front of the stone                    above the lions. The agoranomos that the inscription mentions was the magistrate                    responsible for regulating the activities in the agora, served particularly as                    overseer of the market. They acted alone or in pairs. The name of the agoranomos                    is reconstructed from a lead weight from the same year found in a separate                    excavation. The funnels are each inscribed with the volume that they can                    hold. Only the term δικότυλον is known for the quivalent of the last measure. It                    appears that the system used for this sekoma is based on a progression of 1, 2,                    4, and 8 units. The Maresha sekoma presents clear, direct evidence for the use                    of a kotyle of close to .240 liter in mid-second-century BCE Idumea. The unit of                    reference for Funnels I to III equals four kotyles, which is a choinix. Since                    the choinix is normally used for measuring dry materials is seems stratge to                    fina the value of a chinix used as a reference for liquids on the sekoma. This                    reference to two different standards of measurement which may reflect the need                    to relate to two different standards of volumes.            "

The statue of her at Tel Sandahannah may have been raised for her at the time of that battle.         "

The inscription, engraved in an ellipsoid circle, is seven lines long. The left hand side of the inscription is damaged and the beginning of the third line is illegible. The beginning of the third line most likely represents a name. The י in the second word of the sixth line serves for both דבני and ישראל. The original reading of the inscription by Dr. Sukenik is inaccurate. The last word of line 6 should be דכנישתא and the first two words of line 3 should be בר חנניא. This correction in line 3 negates Sukenik's original argument that the column was donated by a non-Jewish donor. From the name בר חנניא, it is obvious that the column was donated by a Jew, whose name, as well as the names of his father and grandfather, are mentioned. It is possible that the term בר אוכסנטים stands for the name of the family. The term כנישתא in reference to a synagogue is used for the first time here. Otherwise, the word is well-known from Talmudic sources. The phrase ליקרהֿ דכנישתא recalls the usage particularly common among eastern Jews when an offering made in synagogue is announced by בעבור שנדר לכבוד בית הכנסת (""because it was offered in honor of the synagogue"") or לכבוד התורה (""in honor of the Torah""). This reading of ליקרה דכנישתא has been confirmed by mosaic inscriptions at al-Hamme, where the phrase occurs several times. Sukenik first heard of the inscription in Marisa in 1925 when it was located in the home of a man from Beit Jibrin who sold antiquities to tourists and dealers. The stone was afterwards brought to the Palestine Archaeological Museum in Jerusalem.         "

Soot marks on the top of the altar signify its original use for burning incense. It is clear that the inscription was engraved by an unskilled carver because the spaces between the letters are not well calculated. Text begins at the base of the cornice and continues over the body to the upper part of the socket. Traces of red paint can be seen in the writing. Another incense-altar, uninscribed, was also found at this site. Lord Commodus referred to in the inscription is Emperor Commodus (180-192 CE). Elkias may have been ""an official in charge of a cult or of gladiatorial contests."" The god Zeus-Heliopolites was a composite of Greek Zeus and the Syrian thunder god Hadad-Rimmon; he was popular throughout Palestine and appears on coins of Eleutheropolis. The translation is that of Leah di Segni.         "

The name is also mentioned                    as one of the thirteen appellations for Mt. Gerizim in Tibat Marqah (94a,                    224a).            "

The form may also be a variant of בלהה (Bilhah), a                    woman's name; the name proceeding it would then be that of her husband or                    father. If this is indeed the case, it provides evidence for a weakening of the                    guttural consonants, a development which had become quite common among Jews in                    the first century CE.The legible part of the inscription's ending appears                    to consist of the beginning of the word הקרב 'offered.' The inscription probably                    opened with a list of offerers, followed by the verb הקרב.

Malka                    also appears among the Nabateans, as the name of the commander of Antipater's                    forces (Jos., War 1:162; idem, Ant. 14:84), and in the New Testament as the name                    of the High Priest's slave (Malchus; John 18:10)            "

However, in light of the hundreds of inscriptions that have since                    been discovered, there is little doubt that the correct reading is הקרב.  Naveh                    read the extant letters of this line as the Arabic name ועלא. Here too, however,                    the hundreds of inscriptions that have come to light unquestionable indicate                    that the above reading is correct.  This obviously does not affect the truth of                    the claim that some Arabic names are indeed attested in the Mt. Gerizim                    inscriptions; no. 20 contains the names Aslah and Zabdi, both of which are                    clearly Arabic.

Josephus relates (War 4:449) in his description of Vespasian's journey from                    Emmaus to Samaria that ""he came down...by the city, by others called Neapolis                    (or Shechem), but by the people of that country Mabartha."" Pliny (NH 5:69)                    states that the ancient name of Neapolis was Mamortha. Josephus, who spoke                    Hebrew, can be assumed to have written the name more correctly than Pliny.            "

The third letter of this line resembles gimel, but could also be read as                    yod, despite the fact that its right leg contines a bit beyond the head of the                    left leg.  If so, then the extant letters may represent the beginning of a                    personal name such as עלישע (Elisha') or עליהו (Eliyahu), etc.             "

The instances of final and medial mem are not                    distinguished from each other; the letter bet has an elongated base that                    continues underneath the following letters; and the lamed has a kind of flag on                    top as well as a tail twisting downward on the right, two additions indicative                    of a relatively late date. Line 1: The name 'Amram is not common in the corpus.                    In the Samaritan Chronicles five High Priests with this name are mentioned.                    Among the Jews of Jerusalem, the name was relatively rare, appearing only twice                    on first century CE ossuaries, both referring to the same person. Line 2: From                    this line it would appear that 'Amram offered in his own name as well as that of                    his wife and 'his father.' To date, no other dedications for one's father have                    been found among the Mt. Gerizim inscriptions. Perhaps the father in question                    was of a venerable age and the dedication was a mark of respect. Line 3: It                    would appear that the inscription contains the usual expanded form of a                    dedicatory inscription, with the additional prayer for being remembered for good                    before God in this place.

In some cases such a stone was dedicated by a number of offerers,                    due to its great cost. Line 1: The name Yehosef was common during the Second                    Temple period. Jason is a Greek name, also well-attested in Jewish sources. It                    would appear that the carver forgot to inscribe the name of the offerer's town                    and therefore added above the first line, after the offerer's name, the words                    'who is from [GN].] The place-name is not preserved. The word 'son' is written                    as a ligature, a phenomenon frquently encountered in common words. Line 2: The                    word ובאתרא 'and in this place' is a possible reading. The more usual formula is                    דנה לדרכרן טב... באתרא 'for good remembrance ... in this place.' From the                    physical evidence, it appears as if only the one word was inscribed, making it                    difficult to determine the precise formula.            "

While other Hebrew inscriptions were found on Mt. Gerizim, as well, they are all                    written in the Neo-Hebrew script. This is the only Hebrew inscription written in                    typical Proto-Jewish characters. Except for the language used, the inscription                    has a formula that is identical to the expanded version of the Aramaic that                    which offered inscriptions, except that instead 'before God in this place' the                    Hebrew writer preferred replacing the general concepts with explicit names: 'the                    Lord' instead of 'God' and 'in the temple' instead of 'in this place.' There                    would thus appear to be a sort of hierarchy at play: in Hebrew inscriptions                    using the Neo-Hebrew script, the explicit name of the deity is used: YHWH;                    Hebrew inscriptions using the Aramaic script use the appellation 'the Lord'; and                    Aramaic inscriptions in Aramaic script use the general name 'God.'

The words 'this stone' refer to the stone                    block itself. This is one of the rare cases in which the nature of the offering                    is mentioned in a dedicatory inscription on Mt. Gerizim. Perhaps the reason lies                    in the dimensions of the stone: a huge lintel, over two meters long, which was                    certainly very prominent. It is doubtful whether any conclusions can be drawn                    from this text as to the nature of the unidentified offerings in other                    insciriptions -- whether they were stones, as well, or money.

Lines 11-13:                    10:17; the text here uses the Samaritan version of the Pentateuch. Line 14:                    14:12. The inscription consists of the beginning of the Ten Commandments,                    followed by a number of verses dealing with the oneness of God. Much has already                    been writeen on the status of the Ten Commandments in Samaritan mezuzot, as well                    as on the similarities between these inscriptions and certain texts found in                    Qumran. The Talmudic tradition states that the Ten Commandments were part of the                    prayer ritual until they were deleted ""because of the seditious talk of the                    heretics,"" who claimed that it was only they that were given on Mt. Sinai (M                    Tamid 5:1 and Maimonides' commentary ad loc,; JT Berakhot 1:4, 3:3;  BT Berakhot                    12a). In the present inscription these verses relate to the oneness of God; if                    the latter, then this is not a mezuzah but another kind of inscription, which                    can also be found in Samaritan houses to the present, and that possibly has its                    origins in Muslim inscriptions. This stone was probably erected when the                    Samaritan cult was renewed at the site during the Crusader period.            "

The shape of the letter waw in Line 2, whose short diagonal serif at thee head                    begins from the vertical line and descends to the left, leaves no doubt as to                    the late date of the inscription.

Usually offerers mention their wife and sons. The inscription                    appears to be in Neo-Hebrew, with the extant text constituting the usual ending:                    ""That which PN offered for himself and his wife and sons (or father)."" If so,                    then this is a standard dedicatory inscription whose language and script are                    Neo-Hebrew. This usage seemingly shows that the priests considered the                    Neo-Hebrew script to be their own specific script, to be used by them not only                    for special priestly purposes but for standard dedicatory inscriptions, as well.                    The use of the Hebrew language per se is not necessarily proof of priestly                    origin, since a Hebrew language inscription has been found with no priestly                    features at all; only the Neo-Hebrew script is a definite indicator of priestly                    origin.

Perhaps the writer, who used a                    mixture of scripts, wrote a Hebrew nun in place of an Aramaic waw, intending to                    write the word 'his [masc.] brother.' Pinhas may thus have brought the offerring                    for himself and for his brother. As the offerer's name and title indicate, this                    is a priestly inscription. Several of the Mt. Gerizim inscriptions belonging to                    priests have been found, in which the exclusively priestly Neo-Hebrew script was                    used. However, here there is a mixture of the Aramaic and the Neo-Hebrew                    scripts. The Neo-Hebrew letters used here are waw, kaf, and samekh. The                    significance of this inscription, in addition to its peculiar script, lies in                    the fact that it is a standard dedicatory inscription and not a temple                    inscription. This teaches that the Neo-Hebrew script was also used for                    nonpriestly inscriptions.            "

","            The mosaic consists of four lines of Greek and Christian Palestinian Aramaic               (Syro-Palestinian). Each line of the inscription is separated by a row of black               tiles. The first two lines are Greek, the third both Greek and Aramaic, and the               fourth Aramaic. The Aramaic text begins on the fourth line and finishes on the third.               Note that the omega found in the inscription is actually a majuscule-sized minuscule               omega. The ΕΝ ΙϹ is treated in this transliteration as an iotacism and abbreviation               of ΕΝ ΤΗϹ, but Di Segni comments that it may in fact be a ligature rather than an               abbreviation. This view is based upon the bar which appears over the Ν in ΕΝ. In any               case, the translation remains the same. The Greek includes numerous iotacisms,               something which the author indicates is often found among Aramaic speakers. She also               notes that the epithet ""the sinner"" is commonly used in Christian texts in reference               to believers, and that has attestation in Syriac, Arabic and Greek. Two or more lines               of preceding Greek text are missing.The word ending in -ιστον which begins the text               cannot be recovered, but the author offers a superlative, a participle of a verb               ending in -ιζω, or a nominative participle in which the correct -ων was replaced with               an -ον as possible forms. Tentative restorations include κάλλιστον, εὔχαριστον,               φιλόριστον and εὐχαριστῶν. The Greek text refers to an οἶκος, a word which sometimes               means ""house of prayer"" and which therefore may indicate that the mosaic originated               in a sacred building. The translation of the inscription provided is based upon the               surviving Greek and in light of the Aramaic. Note that script of the Aramaic text is               that of Christian Palestinian Aramaic (Syro-Palestinian).         "

","            These two fragments of one inscription on an altar make up one of a number of Greek inscriptions from Senaim on Mount Hermon. Senaim seems to have functioned as the main cult place for local settlements in the region, an area which was from the Hellenistic period on inhabited by Ituraeans. The inscription was found outside of the entrance to a small temple at the site. The temple itself contained three other altars, one of which bore the figure of Helios. The dimensions of fragments A and B are 22 cm high by 33 cm wide and 24 cm high by 50 cm wide, respectively. A, the left half of the inscription, was discovered in 1988, while B was discovered in 1983. The phrase ""For the safety and victory of the lords emperors' is found in other examples from the Syrian/Jordinian region with names specified. The author indicates that the most likely possibilities drawn from these other inscriptions would be either M. Aurelius and L. Verus, M. Aurelius and L. Commodous, or Caracalla, Getta and Julia Domna. Though Julia Domna is mentioned in inscription 9, the author suggests it is more likely that it refers to M. Aurelius and L. Verus, on the eve of the Mesopotamian expedition. These two were mentioned in inscriptions at Phaena and Amman in 163-164 CE and 165-166 CE. The name Netiras is indicated by the author to be well-known and of Semitic origin while the unusual name Sachouos is reported as being attested at least twice from Umm il-Jimal and is equivalent to the Arabic name Shakûḥ. Based on the inscription it seems possible that Netiras was in charge of the records of a Roman auxilary army, though it also is possible these records had to do with civilian matters. The author also indicates that ""ακτα"" represents acta, a Latin loan word. He suggests that this may indicate ""acta militaria"" instead of ""collegii"", but cautions that this cannot be taken for granted. Note that ""κης"" is probably intended as a correction of ""νείκας"", and is found in the interlinear space. It can be restored as ""νείκης"". The author suggests that κὲ ν{ε}ίκα[ς] should instead read καὶ νίκης.         "

The author notes that the name Γάλεσος is unusual though attested in a few texts from Arabia and that it is probably identical to the Nabataean ""glśw"" and the Safaitic ""gls"". Μοβογέος, on the other hand, he notes, is a well known name in Syria and Lebanon probably of Semitic origin. The name Ἀφαρεύς is given as the most likely restoration based upon the inscription's location, though based on the trasnlation provided should have been recorded in the genitive (Ἀφαρἐως). Ἀφαρεύς was chosen as the most likely restoration because it was the only option which has been recorded in relative proximity to Senaim.It is not clear what exactly the katochoi refered to in the inscription were, though they are understood to be temple-seekers or temple-recluses under a vow. These katochoi, however, are not the same as hierodouloi or temple slaves. The author posits that in the Syrian context the katochos may be the equivalent of the Canaanite-Hebrew ""nazir"" who vowed a ""neder"". The author points out that it may be of note that a nearby valley is called by the Arabs ""Marj el-Rahab,"" meaning ""valley of the recluse.""         "

The inscription was found on the steps to a small temple at the site. The temple itself contained three other altars, one of which bore the figure of Helios. The left fragment is 10 cm wide while the right is 46 cm. The pieces were discovered in 1988 and 1986 respectively. The author suggests that the Latin ""L"" indicates an etos, as it cannot stand for a praenomen in Greek text, and that the etos in may in fact refer to the reign of Agrippa II. Based off of this interpretation, he presents a number of dates which the ""A"" and ""I"" could represent. He indicates that the date may have been read either right to left or left to right, and that the I is not clear enough to rule out the possiblity that it is instead the left portion of a K, M or N. The years which he offers based on these possibilities are 1, 11, 21, 41 and 51. Based on paleography, a late first century CE date (such as during the reign of Agrippa II) or a mid-second century CE date is expected. The letters ""A"" and ""N"" are presumed to belong to the dedicator. Though not visible in the photograph the author worked with, he notes that in Applebaum's 1988 publication of the inscription the letters ΙϹ are noted at the end of the first line. If the last word is restored as ἕνεχεν, the first can be restored as εὐχῆς based on frequent attestation of this formula.         "

The inscription was found near the steps to a small temple at the site. The temple itself contained three other altars, one of which bore the figure of Helios. Based on paleography as well as the content of the inscription -- ruling out other eras whose dates would have been too early -- the era of the city of Bostra (which is also that of the province of Arabia) is suggested, giving a date range of 22 March 148 CE to 21 March 149 CE. The author indicates that the use of the era of the city of Bostra does not necessarily indicate a movement of boarders as the dedicator may simply have come to visit Senaim. According to the author the formula εὐξάμενος ἀνέθηκεν is found in many Greek inscriptions from the region, including some found at Gerasa, Bostra, Mechta Helou, the Beqâ. Based on examples from Cyprus it seems to have come into common use during the middle of the second century.         "

Should the last line be correctly restored as θεῷ εὐχὴς the next word would likely be ἕνεχεν as part of a typical formula, though this word is not extant on the fragment.The author indicates that the name Ἀνφίας is unusual, but may be a corruption of Anaphas, Anaphês, Anaphaios or Amphias.

Idideos is not attested as a personal name. It is possible that the form is derived from Zeus Idaios, that is, Zeus who comes from Mount Ida. It would be the dative form Δὶ Ἰδαίῳ with metathesis of the first two letters, omicron for omega, and epsilon for αι, fairly common spellings. The worship of ""mountainous"" gods, foreign and local, was popular through Syria and Phoenicia. The author notes that should this be the case, it does not necessarily indicate that Idaean Zeus is related directly at Senaim; the dedication may be, for example, from a Cretan soldier passing through who noticed similarities between a local god and Idaean Zeus. Dr. I G Davies indicates that Idideos also might have had a semitic origin, for example the Hebrew yadid (beloved). The author also notes that the semitic name Hadad might also be compared. The inscription is probably a dedication, like the others of its group.         "

The pattern suggests that there were originally thirteen dedicatory inscriptions in all. Only the ends of each of this inscription's four lines are preserved. The beginning of line 1 is assumed to be the standard ""Remembered be for..."" The beginning of line 2 is the donor's name, which cannot be accurately reconstructed because only its last letter remains. It might have been Tanhum, Menahem, Nahum, or something else. The phrase ""son of"" at the end of line 2 attests that at the beginning of line 3 appeared the name of the donor's father. The beginning of line 4, preceding the final ""Amen,"" was probably another ""Amen,"" as is true of several of the other inscriptions at this location.         "

The inscription was found outside of the entrance to a small temple at the site. The temple itself contained three other altars, one of which bore the figure of Helios. The sigma which ends the first line is probably the ending of a personal name. The inscription is too fragmentary to restore. The author suggests that if the plural ending of the verb ""to dedicate"" is correctly restored in the second line, there would have been multiple dedicators. If ἱερῷ, in the dative, is a noun and not an adjective then it probably refers to the actual hieron itself. The fragment's lower edge is boarded with two distinct designs.         "

The               restoration of the year is uncertain. The tombstone is one of about 700 discovered in               Byzantine Zoora, and is badly weathered. The majority of the Greek tombstones from               this location have been identified as Christian.

The letter-cutter provides the               third declension genitive Ἀσκληπιάδους although it is actually a first declension               name (nominative: Ἀσκληπιάδης) and therefore should read Ἀσκληπιάδου. μη(νί) is               abbreviated with a small η above the μ. The author suggests a restoration containing               the formula ""θάρσει, οὐδεὶς ἀθάνατος"" as spanning a final two lines which are not               extant. The author indicates that the attestation of the name Σίβυλλα in two epitaphs               in Zoora suggests that local presence of Sibyllic tradition. He also notes that the               Ἀσκληπιάδης of the inscription was probably a member of the medical profession.         "

A day was likely provided among the at least three lines which are no longer extant (having broken off from the bottom of the tombstone). The last two characters on line 6 are also missing due to this break. The script has a round form, and the text is engraved and painted red.

The majority of the Greek tombstones from this location have been identified as Christian.

The tombstone is one of about 700 discovered in Byzantine Zoora. The majority of the Greek tombstones from this location have been identified as Christian. The inscription contains both orthographic and grammatical errors and was recorded in a mixture of square and round script. The text is engraved and painted red. Engraved guide lines are visible between each line of text, as is a square border engraved around the entire epitaph. A vertical stroke is visible after the second μ on line 1, possibly indicating a failed attempt at the inscription of the next letter. The stone is in a good state of preservation, and the text is very clear. In addition, the author notes that there may be a decorative character in the style of a siglum S before the year numeral on the seventh line. Lines 2 and 8 both end with an angular motif. Line 10 ends in Θα, which likely indicates the letter cutter began θάρσι on that line, then decided instead to place the entire word on the next. The title archisynagogos -- usually designating the head of a synagogue, but possibly honorific, or hereditary, rather than functional -- is usually found in a Jewish context, but it is also recorded in certain instances (though none within Palestine) as referring to prominent pagan leaders of certain associations. Still, that author suggests that despite the language (Greek) and formulation (seemingly Christian) of the epitaph, it ""is not unlikely"" that the deceased is Jewish.         "

The abbreviation Θ(εὸ)ς lacks the normally expected horizontal bar above the letters (though this may be due to aging).The text on the final line is faded and is marked with a cross at the end.

He also points out that the use of the participle ἀπογενομένης to indicate a deceased woman is confined to only three epitaphs in the middle of the fourth century.

He suggests that the phrase ""τελεθτηκότων ἐν ὁσιότητι"" indicates that Siltha and Kyra led pious lives. The virtue of ""ὁσιότης"", piety or holiness, is mentioned in three other epitaphs from Ghor es-Safi. In this epitaph, as well as in zoor0023 and zoor0024, the cause of death is indicated to have been the earthquake, recorded by many ancient writers, which took place on May 18th, 363 CE. These three inscriptions are, so far as we know, the only epigraphical records of the date and occurrence of an earthquake in this region. The earthquake seems to have caused damage throughout most of Transjordan and Palestine, and in many accounts is seen to have been divine retribution for the Emperor Julian's attempt to rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem. A parallel to the common burial of a mother and daughter attested in this inscription is found in a fourth century CE epitaph from Cyrene which records the common burial of a mother and son after an earthquake. Similarly, the common burial of a father and son is also attested in a sixth century epitaph CE from Elusa, though their deaths were not attributed to an earthquake.         "

The tombstone is one of about 700 discovered in Byzantine Zoora. The majority of the Greek tombstones from this location have been identified as Christian. The inscription contains numerous spelling errors, and is recorded in a round alphabet with the letters both engraved and painted red. Guide lines are still visible in certain parts of the text. There are numerous crosses engraved in this inscription: The word ""μνημῖον"" on line one is flanked by crosses, line eleven and twelve each end with a cross, and there is a large isosceles cross below the text. The age, year and inverted month day numeral are all indicated with a horizontal stroke above them. The word ἐτῶν is abbreviated with the first two letters and a small oblique stroke to the upper right of the tau, while the word μηνὸςis abbreviated with a small eta over a mu. In this epitaph, as well as in zoor0022 and zoor0024, the cause of death is indicated to have been the earthquake, recorded by many ancient writers, which took place on May 18th, 363 CE. These three inscriptions are, so far as we know, the only epigraphical records of the date and occurrence of an earthquake in this region. The earthquake seems to have caused damage throughout most of Transjordan and Palestine, and in many accounts is seen to have been divine retribution for the Emperor Julian's attempt to rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem. The author notes that the phrase ""Εἷς Θεός"" is found commonly in inscriptions from the East starting in the late third century CE (and becoming increasingly common in the fourth and firth centuries CE), though its placement at Ghor es-Safi is usually at the beginning of the epitaph. The author notes that the deceased named in Zoor00024, Samakon, may be the father of Obbe. This is based upon the patronymic found in this inscription as well as the relative ages of the two figures.         "

The tombstone is one of about 700 discovered in Byzantine Zoora. The majority of the Greek tombstones from this location have been identified as Christian. It is in fair condition, though the text is more difficult to read towards the bottom of the inscription due to salt crystallization over that part of the stone. The text, which contains both spelling and grammatical errors, was engraved in a round script and also painted red (as evidenced by traces of red paint which are still present). An engraved border is visible on the left and right sides of the text along with a vault above the it. The author indicates that the right side of the border and the vault are highlighted in red paint, as well as that a red painted zigzag pattern is found to the right side of the text's boarder. It is of note that this inscription does not contain a patronymic, a rare occurrence at Ghor es-Safi (unless the deceased name is followed by a title), as is the fact that the placement of the ""encouragement phrase"" unexpectedly breaks up the date. The author indicates that the letter nu in the word ἐτῶν on line 5 is inverted and that the theta on line three is carved in ""oblique position"". The age numeral is indicated by a horizontal bar above the letters. The author also points out that the month day numeral iota on line six is more conspicuous because it bears a trema. In addition, he suggests that the letter mu which is seen at the end of the first line seems to have been an attempt by the engraver to begin the name on the following line. Finally, he also notes that the word μηνί on line 5 is abbreviated with a small eta written over a larger mu, and that the final sigma of the word ἔτους on line 8 is also used for the first letter of the following year numeral.

The engraved script is a mixture of round and square alphabets. The text, which contains both spelling and grammatical errors, is surrounded by traces of a square frame painted with dark ochre. In line five, the year numeral is emphasized by a horizontal bar above it.

The missing upper half of the tombstone probably included approximately four lines of text, which may have contained the name of the deceased, their age, and the patronymic.

The monument was found amongst about 700 tombstones discovered in Byzantine Zoora. The majority of the Greek tombstones from this location have been identified as Christian. A tabula ansata is carved in relief on the front of the block, and the upper corner of its right dovetail is chipped. The inscription covers two thirds of smoothed surface of the tabula ansata. Traces of a red horizontal line near the bottom of the tablet are discernible. The round script is deeply engraved and painted over in red. The text contains both a spelling and a grammatical error. In line three, it is unclear whether the verb ἐποίησεν refers to Ulpianus as the commissioner of the monument or its builder; however, the former is more likely based on comparative usage of the verb in Hauran inscriptions. Other features of the block, such as the use of marble, the tabula ansata motif, and its use commemorating the construction of a funerary monument, demonstrate similarities with the material from Hauran. The numeral at the end of line three is unusual in its arrangement of numerical letters in ascending order (tens-units-hundreds). However, such usage is attested elsewhere in year numerals dated according to the Era of Provincia Arabia. The author notes that an oblique stroke on the final ν of the second line is inverted.         "

The nearly rectangular tombstone is chipped on all sides. The smoothed inscribed surface is flaked off in the lower left corner. Although the figures are no longer discernible, traces of red paint in the margins of the inscription suggest that decorations originally flanked the text. The engraved, red-painted outline of a cross is centered below the text. A χ pattern appears in the middle of this cross, while a dot appears within each of its four bars. The round script of the text is engraved and embellished with red paint, which is still discernible in lines one, five, and six. Horizontal bars appear above the abbreviation of the word ἐτῶν and the age numeral in line three, the year numeral in line four, and the inverted month day numeral in line five. Two more engraved crosses with serifs flank line nine of the text. An angular motif appears at the end of line one. Two such motifs appear again at the end of line two. This motif appears again after the age numeral in line three. The text contains both spelling and grammatical errors. The gender of the personal name Θόψη is not certain; however, based on the use of a feminine participle to modify the name in another inscription (no. 141) in this corpus, it seems to refer to a woman. Its femininity is further supported by the appearance of the feminine name Θόψση in Roman period Deir el-Liyat. The occurrence of the name Ἑλλίος is new in the inscriptions of Palestine and Arabia, although it appears in Egyptian papyri.         "

The rectangular tombstone is broken at the upper left corner and chipped in several places. Its smoothed inscribed surface is flaked off at the edges, and there are salt crystals on its left side. The text is surrounded by engraved figures, some of which are discernible. A faint, incised horizontal bar tops the text. Faint traces of figures appear above this bar. A centered cross-rho figure flanked by the letters α and ω appears below the text.

The year numeral in line six is almost covered by salt crystals. A red painted horizontal bar tops the month day numeral in line seven. Although it is no longer discernible in the extant text, the author suggests that line eight probably contained the word Θάρσει. The words of line nine are only faintly discernible. The military title δρακωνάρις, a contracted form of δρακονάριος, refers to someone who carried the standard of a dragon. This term continued to be used even after the dragon iconography was replaced by the cross under Constantine.         "

A red-painted vine motif, surrounding the inscription on the upper, right, and left sides, consists of a continuous wavy line with small fruits drawn in the concave portions of the line. The script itself is engraved and traced in red paint, traces of which are discernible in lines one, four, seven, and eight. A sun-disc, heavily outlined in red paint, appears within the vine motif centered above the text. Three figures appear below the inscription: a faintly discernible, red-painted cross in the middle flanked by two red-painted birds. Another cross figure appears at the beginning of line five. A horizontal bar appears above the age numeral in line four, the abbreviation of Κυρίου in line eight, and the weekday numeral in line eight. A serpentine motif appears in line four, flanking the age numeral on the left with three such lines and the right with five. This motif appears again in line eight: two serpentine lines precede the abbreviation of Κυρίου. An angular motif appears in line five, flanking the year numeral with three such motifs on the left and two on the right. All of these angular motifs point to the left. The month day numeral in line seven is inverted.

The tombstone is one of about 700 discovered in               Byzantine Zoora. The majority of the Greek tombstones from this location have been               identified as Christian. The nearly rectangular tombstone is chipped around all its               edges. The smoothed inscribed surface is slightly hollowed. The text is surrounded by               a engraved frame which is painted red on its left, right, and bottom sides. The round               script of the text is engraved and painted red, with traces of paint still               discernible in lines one, two, seven, eight, thirteen, and fourteen. The script is               set within incised guide-lines, some of which are also painted red. A sun-disc figure               centered below the text is drawn heavily with red paint. Several small, paint-filled               triangles appear around this disc. The text is flanked by two vertical lines to which               more triangles are attached. These triangles are either outlined or filled with               paint. Four vertical snakes appear on each side of this decorated frame, the head of               one snake touching the tail of the next. Serpentine motifs flank the year, month day,               and weekday numerals in lines nine, ten, and eleven, respectively. A horizontal               stroke above the provided letters denotes the abbreviations for Κυρίου and Κυρίος in               lines ten and thirteen. The text contains both spelling and grammatical errors. In               addition, the correct syntax of the first line should read: μνῆμαν ἀποθέσεως               σκηνώματος Ὀμμαβίης. Although the term Μνῆμαν is widely attested in the funerary               epigraphy of Palestine and Arabia, it is otherwise unattested in Ghor es-Safi, where               the term μνημεῖον is common. Similarly, the term ἀπόθεσις, meaning ""burial,"" is               otherwise unattested in Palestine, where the term κατάθεσις is more common. The use               of the term σκήνωμα, meaning ""corpse"" here, relies upon an earlier metaphor in which               the body is viewed as a tent in which the soul dwells. This metaphorical usage was               eventually lost, and the term subsequently appears in both Christian and pagan               funerary contexts. The personal name Ὀυμμαβίη appears elsewhere in this corpus (no.               34), as does the name Νεῖλος (no. 190), which appears in several Egyptian               inscriptions. The verbs ἀποίχομαι, ""to be done, have departed,"" and ἀποσκέλλω, ""to be               dried up, wither,"" have both acquired the metaphorical meaning, ""to die"" in this               inscription. The word μονή, originally ""abode, lodging,"" has also acquired the               metaphorical meaning ""heaven."" Thus, lines eleven through fourteen exhort the reader               to pray for the deceased so that she may dwell with the saints in heaven. The               elaborate decoration and inscription suggest that the deceased was a distinguished               woman in the community.         "

","            The inscription provides the date as the 12th day in the month of Hyperberetaios in the year 300 according to the Era of the Province of Arabia, that is, September 29, 405 CE. The tombstone is one of about 700 discovered in Byzantine Zoora. The majority of the Greek tombstones from this location have been identified as Christian. The nearly rectangular tombstone is broken at the upper left and lower right corners. The smoothed, inscribed surface is badly weathered, making several letters of the text unclear. Salt crystal have accumulated in the lower section of this surface. Both the text and the decorative figures on the surface are engraved and painted red. The script of the text is a mixture of round and square letters. A centered cross-rho figure appear above the text, flanked by two crosses. The cross on the left is simply engraved, while the one on the right is an outlined cross. Two horizontal palm branches appear below the text. A left-facing bird stands upon the left palm branch, while a cross with the letter χ inscribed in its center stands upon the right. The weekday numeral in line twelve is flanked on the left by two serpentine motifs and on the right by one left-facing angular motif. The gender of the personal name Ἀννῆς is unclear because the form may be interpreted as either masculine nominative or feminine genitive. In either case, the name is derived from the Semitic root meaning ""to be benevolent."" The bearer of this name is one of the most long-lived people in this corpus. The restoration of the name Σαββινιός is unclear due to the poorly preserved state of those seven letters. This name is attested nearby in Moab, Khirbet es-Samra, and Hauran. The affirmative phrase μετὰ καλοῦ ὀνόματος καὶ καλῆς πίστεως occurs frequently in this corpus of epitaphs. Although the nature of this ""good name"" is unclear, it may refer to self-identification with the name Χριστιανός, ""Christian."" Furthermore, its appearance with the word πιστός in this phrase may indicate some relationship with baptism, since both qualities, Χριστιανός and πιστός, were conferred at baptism. In fact, from the third or fourth to the seventh century, both epithets appear in Byzantine epitaphs to indicate that the deceased was baptized.         "

The tombstone is one of about 700 discovered in Byzantine Zoora. The majority of the Greek tombstones from this location have been identified as Christian. The nearly rectangular tombstone is chipped on all sides and has a smoothed inscribed surface, except for a lower, rough section.

One is found outside the frame on the right side of the stone, while three more are depicted between the frame and the first line of text. Two more cross-rho figures flank the expression Εἷς Θεός in line one. Three more red-painted cross-rho figures with more elaborate decorative features appear in a line below the text. The central figure has a dot in each of its four corners, and the letters α and ω flank it on the left and right. The left figure has four small, serpentine motifs in its corners. The right figure has the letters α and ω written above its horizontal bar. The abbreviation for the word Ὑπερβερεταίῳ in line six consists of the first five letter, the letter ρ, and the S symbol.

The round script is engraved, and traces of red paint appear in lines one, five, and six. The inscription is surrounded by a rectangular frame, and lines one, two, and four are set within incised guide-lines. Both the frame and the last guide-line retain their red paint. Above the upper side of the frame, traces of engraved letters suggest that the phrase εἷς θεός was originally here. Below the inscription, a centered, engraved cross-rho figure is flanked by two palm branches drawn in red paint. Traces of red-painted angular motifs are discernible between the cross-rho and the right palm branch. Lines five through eight begin with several uninscribed spaces, which appear on a lighter patch of the stone. A horizontal bar tops the year numeral in line four, and a horizontal stroke tops the month day numeral in line six. The text contains both spelling and grammatical errors. The syllable -να in the word ἀθάνατος is omitted in lines seven and eight. The personal name Μάγδιος appears as the patronymic elsewhere in this corpus (nos. 193, 276). The name is derived from the Semitic root mgd, meaning ""to be glorious."" The personal name Εὐφράσιος is relatively rare in Palestine; aside from this attestation, it only appears in two other Christian inscriptions from Hammat Gader and Kafr Kama. The use of the verb κοιμάομαι in Christian funerary epigraphy evokes the image of death as long sleep in anticipation of resurrection. Jesus uses this verb to describe the death of Lazarus in John 11:11.         "

Three serpentine motifs appear before the sign of the age numeral in line seven. The text contains both spelling and grammatical errors.

The personal name Κέλσος is otherwise unattested in the inscriptions of Palestine and Arabia, although it does appear in the papyri of Roman Egypt. The patronymic Μίλικος may be a variant of the Semitic name Μάλεχος or derived from the Greek adjective μειλίχιος, meaning ""gentle, meek."" The author suggests that despite the Latin origin of the name Κέλσος, the patronymic indicates that the deceased was a native. The burial formula ἀποθανὸν ἐκ τοῦ βίου in lines three and four is less common in Ghor es-Safi than παυσόμενος, -ένη τοῦ βίου.""         "

The tombstone is one of about 700 discovered in Byzantine Zoora. The majority of the Greek tombstones from this location have been identified as Christian. The nearly rectangular stone is broken in the upper and lower left corners and chipped all around. The smoothed, inscribed surface is chipped on the lower left side. The engraved text, written in round script, is set within incised guide-lines, which extend one line above and three lines below the text. Two cross motifs appear in the lines below the text on the right and left sides of the stone. Each motif is comprised of an outlined cross with serifs and a smaller simple cross inscribed within it. The horizontal bar of the simple crosses coincide with a guide-line. The cross motif on the right is larger than the one on the left. The text contains both spelling and grammatical errors. A horizontal bar appears above the age numeral in line three, the units figure of the year numeral in line five, and the inverted month day in line six. The units figure of the year numeral is given with a numerical sign, while the tens and hundreds figures are written as ordinal numbers. The weekday numeral in line seven is topped with a horizontal stroke. In line eight, the hour is given in a cardinal rather than an ordinal number. The author notes that διὰ ἔτους is a mistake, and ought to have been written as ἐν ἔτει. The personal name Ἀκλαύδις is the contracted form of the Latin Claudius, preceded by the vowel α, which was ""probably added for the adaptation of this foreign name to the local pronunciation."" Because of its case, it is unclear how the personal name Θεόδορος is function in this text. If it were a patronymic, we would expect the genitive. In the nominative case, this name may either refer to the patronymic (in the wrong case) or the cognomen of the deceased (""in that case, Ἀκλαύδις would be his gentilicum""). Rarely attested in Palestine, this is the first example of a recorded hour of death in Ghor es-Safi. No Arabian attestations are known, and only three other occurrences appear elsewhere in Palestine. All three come from the Negev sites of 'Avdat and Beersheva. Based on the division of day and night depicted by the Gospels and Acts of the Apostles, the fifth hour was approximately 11 o'clock in the morning. If the death had occurred at night, we would expect the phrase τῆς νυκτός to accompany the time.         "

The weekday numeral in line twelve is decorated with a horizontal bar above it and two right-facing angular motifs following it. The text contains both spelling and grammatical errors. The name and gender of the deceased in uncertain due to the heavy weathering of the letters in lines two and five which has obscured the name and the gender of the participle. The reading of the patronymic is similarly speculative. If the reconstruction Ἀζίζου is correct, then it is the first attestation of this name at Ghor es-Safi.         "

The rectangular tombstone has been mended from five fragments. A vaulted structure serves as a frame for the text. The structure is drawn in red paint, and consists of an arch and two piers. The two extant lines of text were engraved and painted black. Red painted double guide-lines seem to indicate that 16 more lines of text, probably written in black paint, have been lost. The lower portion of the text-area is interrupted on the left and right by the same red painted illustration: A rectangular frame holds a big lozenge, which itself houses a double rectangle with an inscribed lozenge. Inside this inner lozenge is a small solid-red painted circle. Separately, red painted pomegranates are found below the arch of the frame, while more are depicted below the structure. Left of the bottom pomegranates an illustration of a bird is eating grapes is drawn in black paint. Traces of black paint indicate that a second bird may have been illustrated to the right of this picture. The author remarks that the material, the high quality of the lettering, and the abundant decorations probably indicate that this was the tombstone of someone important within the community. She also notes that if the restorations are correct, these names are attested elsewhere at Ghor es-Safi.         "

It is quite possible that their father Antys outlived his two sons                    and did not yet have his own tomb, impelling him to bury them with his                    uncle.            "

A thick horizontal line, corresponding with the upper edge of the horizontal bar of the cross, rests upon the capitals of the columns. Below the text, the base of the vault is attached to the two columns and consists of a decorative band containing a ""series of interlaced small serpents."" The cross shape of the text creates four empty corners within the vault, each containing its own decorative motif. An outlined, red painted circle appears in the upper left and right corners. An octagonal shape, formed with two diagonally intersecting squares and whose interior contains a cross, appears in the lower left and right corners. The center of the cross contained within each shape is emphasized by a circle of red paint. An omega-shaped figure appears at the corners of the right octagonal shape. Above the vertical bar of the cross, a series of irregular dots appears, which may imitate pomegranates. A horizontal bar appears above the age numeral in line seven, the month day numeral in line eight, and the abbreviation of Κυρίου in line ten. A red painted horizontal stroke appears above the weekday numeral in line ten. The text contains both spelling and grammatical errors.         "

Geometric mosaics and and figurative elements of the mosaics inform the date range. Because of the uncertainty of paleography in Palestinian synagogues, and because at this synagogue the inscriptions seem to have been executed by craftsmen unfamiliar with the Hebrew alphabet, the script itself cannot provide chronological information. Each season is represented by a female bust with her head in three-quarter view. Winter wears earrings, a mantle (pallium) over her hair of black, white, and light blue, with drapery over her breast and shoulders in the same colors, with the addition of green. The mantle makes her appear older. An S-shaped water jug spilling water appears in front of her left shoulder, presumably held up by her left hand. The tiles over her right shoulder do not survive, but a fragment of another attribute (perhaps a twig) remains there. Other representations of the four seasons in Palestinian synagogues at Beth Alpha, Na'aran, and Isfiya have little in common with those here. More similarities exist between these and those of the ""Roman Villa"" at Beth Guvrin, but the nearest parallels are found in the mosaics at Antioch (in modern Turkey). The entire central panel of the synagogue floor has dimensions 3.3 m by 3.26 m, roughly a square. It encloses two concentric circles, with diameters of 3.2 m and 1.4 m. The smaller circle encloses a representation of Helios driving the solar chariot; the area between the two circles is split into twelve panels containing labelled representations of the Zodiac signs; and each corner of the square contains a labelled representation of the season corresponding to its three tangent Zodiac signs. All figures are oriented with their top ends, where their labels appear, towards the center of the circles. The spandrel-shaped season panels have black, brown, red, tan, and white line borders, each one, two, or three tiles deep. The use of Hebrew is notable, since by this period it had been superceded by Aramaic and Greek in everyday business of the synagogue. The orthography is ""defective,"" not plene; for example, תשרי here appears as תישרי at Beth Alpha. The Seasons have the same defective spelling, however, at the 'En Gedi synagogue.         "

(It is difficult to interpret the middle figure because it is unsophisticated and lacking the bottom ""stand"" and curved branches that can distinguish a menorah from a ""tree of life."") Some illumination, however, is provided by a second stone found in the same building, on which a menorah (also with straight branches, but having a bottom stand) is flanked by two circles. As confirmed by several examples from various sites, the latter may be interpreted as Torah scrolls.         "

The stone features a chi-rho at the beginning of the transcription. In the middle of the stone, there is an encircled, stylized palm tree with the text wrapped around the figure. The epigraph contains formulae similar to many dedicatory inscriptions. The recovery of the stone permits the correction of earlier published drawings by Oliphant and Schumacher, though Oliphant saw the epigraph prior to the chipping of the right side. Problems of interpretation, however, remain. There are two grammatical irregularities: the use of the genitive where the accusative is expected after ἔκτισεν, and βοήθει with the genitive.

I built (the) oromonium (mountain monastery?), Mary, it being(?) your sanctuary.         ","            Door lintel, which is presumably complete. This door lintel probably formed part of a doorway of a church or martyrium. Three incised crosses and the (misspelled) word μαρτύριον mark the epigraph as Christian. Although the lettering is clear, problems of reading and interpretation persist. It is unclear in what order the four lines are to be read. A line of five small letters at the top right of the stone (some chipping may obscure additional preceding letters) continues in another series of small letters, also on the right half of the stone which read ΜΟΡΤΟΡΙΟΥΣΟΥ. These two lines together represent an addition or continuation of the two lines which run the full length of the lintel, and are primary. The sentence commences, to the right of the cross, with the first line of large letters, the first five or so marked as abbreviations by the horizontal lines above them. Gregg identifies two possible interpretations. Either the first six letters are involved and signify Χ(ΡΙΣΤ)Ο(Σ) Υ(Ι)Ο(Σ) Θ(ΕΟ)Υ, which has documented analogous inscriptions, or the first five letters are to be read as Χ(ΡΙΣΤ)Ο(Σ) Κ(ΥΡΙ)Ο(Σ) Θ(ΕΟΣ). This acclamation is succeeded by the letter ΟΡΟΜΟΝΙΟΝ, after which comes the aorist first-person verb ᾠκοδόμησα. Three spaces, in which two upright lines are barely legible, stand in front of the clearly inscribed Μαρία. It is difficult to know whether ΟΡΟΜΟΝΙΟΝ should be taken as the subject or the object of the verb. It seems that the builder is not named, but the building. Gregg suggests that ὀρομόνιον may be a noun which identifies a mountain monastic building, as a 9th century work refers to monastics as ὀρεόμονες, or mountain dwellers. If this is correct, the unnamed person who dedicates the structure addresses St. Mary, and the interlinear phrase elaborates that this is a sanctuary (or church) in her honor. In this case, the first line is Line 3, the second Line 1, the third Line 4, and the fourth Line 2 of the completed sentence of the inscription. Here, the diplomatic shows the lines as laid out on the stone and the transcription places them in their proposed order, following Gregg. Line 3 remains problematic as it is either an incomplete phrase preceded by now unidentifiable letters, or an attempted genitive absolute. Gregg proposes the latter, which would yield: ""I built a mountain monastic dwelling (?), Mary; it is your church.""         "

However, examination of a photograph provided by Dauphin raises questions as to Ilan's interpretation. The initial marking stands a bit above the first line of letters, and may be a simple decorative cross rather than a tau. It is not clear whether additional letters once stood to the left in both lines. Therefore, Gregg offers an alternative interpretation represented here. The inscription itself contains several clear elements. The name Ἰουλιανός in line 1 is unambiguous, and forms of τελειόω appear regularly in similar inscriptions in Syria. The second name, Ζαβαελ(ο)υ, is attested.         "

The author               indicates that the script and introductory formula suggest a fourth to fifth century               date. Thοugh the original provenance of the plaque is unknown, the author notes that               formula θήκη τοῦ δεῖνα is found commonly found along the Mediterranean coast between               central Palestine and western Cilicia. As Early Byzantine epitaphs in Cilicia tended               to be carved directly into sarcophagi, the author suggests that the inscription was               originally from the Syro-Palestinian coast. The name Kolokasios is likely a signum               (that is, nickname) of Jeremias. The author indicates that lines 3 through 6 are               difficult to translate as a result of some confusion about the names Theodotos and               Iose and the engraver's use of line breaks in the middle of words. The translation               ""Grave of Jermias Kolokasios, son of Iose and Theodotos. To you, their son!"" is               posited as a possible alternative. A menorah figure is engraved at the end of the               last line of text. The author indicates that verb ἀνέθηκαν or ἐποίηςαν, omitted in               many funerary inscriptions, should be understood in the final line of the               inscription. The inscription uses large miniscule omegas in the place of majuscule               omegas.         "

In ancient context, the Zodiac can be understood as a schematic system for reckoning time. The fixed calendar akin to a modern one was not introduced until the days of Hillel II, circa 320 to 330 CE. Geometric mosaics and and figurative elements of the mosaics inform the date range. Because of the uncertainty of paleography in Palestinian synagogues, and because at this synagogue the inscriptions seem to have been executed by craftsmen unfamiliar with the Hebrew alphabet, the script itself cannot provide chronological information. Dimensions refer to the entire central panel of the synagogue floor, roughly a square. It encloses two concentric circles, with diameters of 3.2 m and 1.4 m. The smaller circle encloses a representation of Helios driving the solar chariot; the area between the circles is split into twelve voussoir-shaped panels containing labelled representations of the Zodiac signs, each about 55 cm in length; and each corner of the square contains one labelled representation of the season that corresponds to its three tangent Zodiac signs, personified by a woman. All figures are oriented with their top ends, where their labels appear, towards the center of the circles. A twisted ribbon delineates both circles and each panel. Walls of the Stratum I synagogue, built over this mosaic, obscure all of Sagittarius, nearly all of Cancer, and some of Gemini and Scorpio. The sign of Aries is a galloping ram; that of Taurus is a galloping, humped bull with horns shown frontally; that of Gemini is a pair of naked twins, apparently uncircumcised and holding hands, of which only one is still visible; of the sign of Cancer, only the tip of a crab's leg is preserved. Leo is represented by a ferocious lion rearing up on his hind legs; Virgo by a standing virgin with a torch in her left hand, wearing a pallium, or white veil, a red tunic with black stripes, and red footwear; Libra by a muscular, uncircumcised man clad only in a chlamys, holding a royal scepter; Scorpio by a scorpion of which only the tail and the middle of the body, with two left legs and four right, survive. Nothing is visible of the archer that would presumably represent Sagittarius. Capricorn is represented by a monster with erect horns in leaping position; Aquarius by an athletic young male pouring water from a spouted jug held over his left shoulder, supported at top with his right hand and at bottom with his left; and Pisces by a pair of fishes swimming in opposite directions, one above the other. The word דלי, Aquarius, is written in mirror writing, perhaps indicative of workmen unfamiliar with the language and characters. The use of Hebrew is notable, since by this period it had been superceded by Aramaic and Greek in everyday business of the synagogue.         "

Amen, Amen, Selah, and for myself Amen.         ","            The Galilean Aramaic of this inscription informs the date range, while the lettering itself holds little information. (There are no differences between heh and het or between waw and yod, but dalet and resh are different.) This inscription sits in a tabula ansata beneath a Greek dedicatory inscription (see inscription tibe0005); the entire tabula measures 70 by 140 cm. A red ivy leaf appears in the northern ansa. The upper half of the tabula, containing the Greek inscription, was found rather well preserved in situ, while the lower half was discovered broken in pieces, having been forcibly removed at some earlier time. The orientation and prominent position of the tabula may suggest that this spot was used to collect donations from congregants. This is the first discovery of Aramaic and Greek inscriptions within a tabula. The inclusion of Aramaic at all, when most of the synagogue's inscriptions are in Greek, suggests that at least some congregants knew and used the language. The phrases of blessing יהי שלמה על and תהי לה ברכתה are common, as is the closing אמן אמן סלה. The idiom דעבד מצותה, literally ""who did (or does) the good deed,"" is found here for the first time; עבד usually has the meaning ""donated"" (for a building or building part), and appearing with מצוה it has the meaning ""voluntary offering"" or ""charity donation."" The phrase אתרה קדישה, ""holy place,"" was argued by Vincent to mean ""synagogue"" (Revue Biblique, 30, ""La synagogue de Noarah,"" 1921). It appears in Beth Shean, several times in Na'aran, in Talmudic Hebrew as מקום קדוש, and in Greek, here in the Synagogue of Severos, as ο ἁγίος τόπος. ולי combined with אמן could be a haph'el form of the verb אמן, with ולי meaning ""proper, fitting,"" but this word is found in the Eastern Aramaic dialect in only three texts (quite different from the one here: BT Nedarim 8:b, Berakoth 55:b, and the Aramaic Proverbs), and not at all in Palestinian Aramaic, the language of this inscription -- rendering that reading quite unlikely. The he emphaticus of שלמה occurs in all proper nouns of the inscription; this is common in Galilean Aramaic synagogue inscriptions, but never appears in Hebrew ones.         "

","            The inscription provides the date as the 17th day of the month Loos in the year 287 according to the Era of the Province of Arabia, that is, August 5, 392 CE. The tombstone is one of about 700 discovered in Byzantine Zoora. The majority of the Greek tombstones from this location have been identified as Christian. The rectangular tombstone is broken on the left side, causing a loss of text at the beginning of lines four through seven. The smoothed inscribed surface suffers from wear, particularly in its upper and lower extremities. Three figures appear below the text, all of which are engraved and contain remnants of red paint: A centered, vertical palm branch, flanked by two cross-rho figures. The square script of the text is similarly engraved and also appears to have been painted red. The genitive ending of the personal name Παρθενίος is written between lines one and two due to a lack of space. Multiple spelling errors appear in the text. The author notes that the personal name Ὀνένος is the hypocoristicon of the Hellenized Semitic name Ἄνανος, which is derived from the Semitic root meaning ""merciful, favorable."" The encouragement formula Θάρσει, οὐδεὶς ἀθάνατος, which usually appears at the end of an epitaph, appears in the middle of this text. Such disruptive syntax is attested elsewhere in this corpus of tombstone inscriptions. Although the hundreds and tens of the year numeral are given in ordinal numbers, the units figure is given in numerical sign. The month day numeral is inverted in line ten.         "

The church complex comprises a large courtyard, water cisterns, wine-pressing installations, and several tombs. The sides of the mosaic in Room A are all one meter in length. The framed inscription is situated in the center of the mosaic. The letters are made out of black stones and placed on a white background. The inscription does not have spelling or grammatical errors. The only abbreviation used was that of the sacra nomina, or the sacred name, in the first line. The first five lines of the inscription are damaged. The text is a supplication, in which a person asks a supernatural deity to provide something. The individual who wrote the inscription is asking Jesus to remember a person who has passed away, whose name has not been preserved, and he/she is also asking for the remembrance of those who pray and contribute to this place. The inscription therefore showcases the significance of this place for Christians.         "

The inscription is complete, but is badly worn in the lower half. Only the first three lines can be read with confidence. ΜΝΣΣ is a variation on a familiar abbreviation. The abbreviation symbol S at the end of line 2 strongly suggests the common designation for presbyter, despite the indefiniteness of the letter Gregg reads as rho. The last letter of line 3 is illegible, making it difficult to interpret the end of the name. The inscription is identified as Christian by the presence of an incised cross at the top center and a chi-rho at the beginning of the inscription. Additional Christian symbols were detected at the bottom of the inscription. There is a faintly etched omega and alpha above a carved disk, within which there is an upright chi-rho similar to that in line 1.         "

","            Dedicatory inscription on the floor in the eastern part of the prayer hall.

The mosaic has black letters set into the smaller white square backgrounds. The inscription is split between two squares of 6 lines each, beginning with the first six in the square on the left and ending with the last six on the right. There is also another equally sized square in between these two which contains geometric art. There is damage to right side of the lines 2 through 6 as well as below the square on the right. The inscription found in Birs0007 was located right about this one. The editor suggests that these two inscriptions be viewed as forming a continuous text and that the word Ἀρχιποιμήν (chief-shepherd) must refer to the title of Bishop. He also indicates that the phrase ""the saints are adorned"" likely refers to the colored mosaic pavements and the patron saint of the church and that the name Makedonios is common at this time, particularly for members of the clergy. The inscription makes use of lunate sigmas as well as large miniscule omegas (in the place of majuscule omegas). Finally, the editor's diplomatic records the abbreviation for ὁσιώτατος on line 4 with a superscript S, while the abbreviation of ἀγάλλεται on line 10 is marked with a full sized S.         "

In the years of Thookon and the priest Stephanos it was entirely                    completed with labor.         ","            Dedicatory inscription made of black letters set into a white rectangular background and framed in tabula ansata. There is a geometric border of black and white tiles below the text. It is located on the floor of the baptistery chapel in front of the baptismal front. This inscription stands out from Birs0001 and Birs0003-0009 because of the language. Whereas the other inscriptions from this church are recorded in Byzantine Greek, this one is recorded in an epic idiom very similar to the Homeric. It is not clear from the text whether the chapel alone or the entire church is named for the Trinity. The ""comites"" to which this inscription refers were a select group of cavalry units ranking higher than the legions and who after the time of Diocletian served as bodyguards to high ranking officials. The editor notes that Halladios of Gerar was likely the governor of the imperial estate (saltus) of Gerar by the time this inscription was recorded. Birsame seems to have been the location of the military headquarters of the imperial estate of Gerar in the 5th and 6th Centuries CE. There is a damaged area in the artistic mosaic below the inscription. The editor suggests that it can be taken as either a nominative singular or a genitive plural, and seems to be either a personal name or that of a unit or group. The Stephanos mentioned in this inscription seems to have been the religious authority (and probably bishop) of the estate, and is also mentioned in Birs0004, Birs0007, and Birs0008. He is referred to as a ἰερεύς in this inscription and (possibly) Birs0004 and as a πρεσβύτερος in Birs0007 and Birs0008.

It is located to the left of the baptismal font of the church. An unclear decoration, perhaps a diamond or flower, sits within the circle above the text. A dash at the end of the fourth line signifies the abbreviation of Στεφάνου to Στεφ, while καὶ is abbreviated with what appears to be a subscript final sigma. The word salvation (σωτηρίας) can apply to a living or dead person, while the word rest (ἀναπαύσεως) was applied only to the deceased. The creator of the inscription uses this distinction to indicate that Theodoros is living and that the other three figures are not. The editor indicates that the figures mentioned here either had a connection to the construction of the church or were important in the community. He also notes that their lack of titles probably indicates that they did not hold ecclesiastical offices. There is a grammatical error on the third and fourth lines of the inscription where the word ἀναπάύσεως appears as ἀναπασεως. The inscription makes use of lunate sigmas as well as large miniscule omegas (in the place of majuscule omegas). The names Theodoros and Stephanos are of Greek origin, while the names Ommoselame and Zonene are Semitic. The editor suggests that the unfamiliar name Ommoselame comes from the Arabic Um-Shalam.         "

The word salvation (σωτηρίας) can apply to a living or dead person, while the word rest (ἀναπαύσεως) was applied only to the deceased. The different application of these two words indicates that Alphios was living at the time of the inscription, while Dionysia (who was likely a member of his family) was not. The inscription makes use of lunate sigmas as well as large miniscule omegas (in the place of majuscule omegas). The last line of the inscription is damaged. The editor notes that the name Alphios is of Semitic origin and that the name Dionysia, while originally pagan, had become a common name for Christians as well during this period.         "

The Stephanos mentioned in this inscription is most likely the same priest Stephanos mentioned in Birs0002, Birs0007, and Birs0008. The command to remember (μνήσθητι) can be applied to both the living and dead, and the editor suggests that in this case both Stephanos and Victor were alive when the inscription was made. Victor is commemorated as the keeper of the food storerooms (κελαρίτην). The editor notes that this usage is unusual, as this title is found neither in Greek literary nor Christian epigraphic sources. Instead, the term oiconomos is generally encountered. The inscription makes use of lunate sigmas. The name Stephanos and Victor are of Greek and Latin origin, respectively.         "

The editor notes that               this text is of a very different nature than the others from the site, containing a               quotation from Psalm 93:5 and from the Eastern Christian Liturgy. The priest               Stephanos mentioned in the inscription is the same one mentioned in Birs0002,               Birs0004, and Birs007.

Two or three lines of text seem to be missing, followed by a line on which only four letters survive. Three restorable lines follow, though their right sides have been destroyed. Based on the surviving text, the inscription seems to be a laudatory chant to Saint Stephanos with its phraseology coming from ecclesiastical hymonology. Saint Stephanos seems to have been particularly popular in the region in the 5th and 6th century, as many churches from this period which have been found were dedicated to him have been found. He is referred to as archdeacon because of his place as one of the seven first deacons who served the Christians of Jerusalem (according to Acts 6-7). His title of first-martyr (πρωτομάρυς) comes from the claim in Acts 7:59-60 that he was the first martyred Christian (having been stoned to death in 35 CE).

The editor indicates that these two titles can both be equally used to indicate the same clerical rank of priest. He is also identified in this inscription as the paramonarios, a position which was part of the religious administrative hierarchy and which indicates that he was the bailiff or guardian of the church. Stephanos was therefore the highest ranked ecclesiastical figure at Birsama. The name Stephanos is of Greek origin. The inscription makes use of lunate sigmas as well as large miniscule omegas (in the place of majuscule omegas).

Block b, broken on the right end, measures 2.20 m long, 0.92 m high, and 0.75 m wide. Much of the tops of both blocks is broken off,           but a dowel hole 70 by 60 mm is preserved to 30 mm deep on the top of block a, and in the top of b are a dowel hole 70 by 80 mm           preserved to 0.10 m deep and a pry-hole. The left ends of both blocks preserve evidence of anathyrosis.           Block a is cut with bevel on the back of its left side, as if to accomodate an outside return. The anathyrosis proves that there was           another block to the left of a, and the bevel indicates that it turned a corner. Decoration is identical front and back: in the frieze a           series of poorly preserved sprigs of flowers or leaves inside swags; in the architrave a cornice 0.19-0.20 m high, projecting 60-70 mm,           of crude Lesbian leaves above egg-and-dart and astragals-and-rod motiffs, with fascias separated by ropes or astragals-and-rods.           On the soffits of the blocks is a running vine in a panel 0.13 m wide. The inscription is in the upper two fascias, each 0.13-0.14 m wide.           Ivy leaves before FL, AVG, and HER apparently mark abbreviations. The letters are well formed, regular, and deeply cut, with serifs, in a monumental alphabet generally characteristic of the 1st and 2nd centuries CE. Block a preserves only two letters of line 1 (block b continues ""Primae""), and block b begins with the word patra in line 2. When block b was found, it was in the moat after falling from the position where it had been reused in the Muslim/Crusader Wall.         "

On the left side is a dowel hole 60 mm in diameter and 35 mm deep. On top are               two holes 40 x 30 x 20 mm near the back corners and a long hole 140 x 50 x 20 mm in               the center. Block b is 0.56 m high, 0.87 m long, and 0.61 m thick. The upper left has               been broken or cut away. On the right is a dowel hole 90 mm in diameter and 60 mm               deep, and on the left is a dowel hole 58 mm in diameter and 45 mm deep. A pouring               channel survives from the top to the hole on the left side. In the center of the top               is a hole 125 x 45 x 90 mm, and on the bottom of the stone the builder's mark               epsilon. Block c is 0.55 m high, 0.85 m long, and 0.61 m thick.

The clamp holes presumably belong to the               original use, the inscription to the second use when the blocks were installed in a               different sequence. Block a begins at the third letter, nu, and ends at the ninth               letter, pi. Block b begins with the tenth letter, omicron, and ends with the               eighteenth letter, sigma.

Above a simple massive base and below an elaborately molded crown are niches on all four sides, each distyle with a conch semivault. On the fascia of the crown at the front of the altar is an inscription in one line, only the last few letters of which survive (text a/line 1). The fragment carrying text a has moldings and letters identical to those on the large fragments, although it does not join. The niches are in various states of completion. The niche at the front, the most finished, has an inscribed panel 0.30 m wide and 0.10 m high at its bottom with text b (lines 2 and 3); above is an eagle crowned by a small Victory in the vault. The left side has a Minerva, the right a Tyche, and the back a Victory. The letters are finely cut, and, like those on the crown, are filled with red paint. Apostrophe-shaped marks divide and end words or indicate abbreviations on the crown and on the second line of the panel. The 7-shaped symbol designates centurio in line 3.

It could be read as the father of two brothers or could be interpreted as ""a native of..."", possibly from Κρουνοί in Mysia near the Pontus. But, Landau says that it is more likely that it is a metathesis, or a rearranging of syllables and letters, of Κουρν(ί)ου. If this interpretation is accurate, it is possible that it stands for Κυρνίου, a Corsican, someone from the Mediterranean island of Corsica. A more convincing reading, made by Naveh, is that this metathesis refers to כפר קרנוס, or Kefar Karnus, a village north of Beth-Shean, which is mentioned in the seventh line of the inscription from the ancient synagogue in Rehov and in parallel literary texts.

The stone does not appear to have been damaged or unfinished, and was found incorporated into the foundation of an abandoned Beduin structure. The Greek phrase here may have been employed by both Jewish and pagan cults, though it may be particularly associated with the cult of Baalshamin or with another cult, near the Negev, of Theos Hypsistos. In this location, a Nabatean rather than a Palmyrene inscription would be expected; it was probably inscribed by a trader or Roman soldier or official of Palmyrene origin. The line may be translated as ""I remembered"" or ""I was remembered,"" but the interpretation here -- an imperative ""Remember!"" addressed to a god -- is most plausible on account of numerous parallels in Greek epigraphy. The author proposes a two-author reading of this text, particularly in light of the fact that most (presumably single-author) bilingual inscriptions contain repeating information in the two languages.

This advancement is rapid and suggests that he was from a respectable family or that he exhibited extraordinary ability. Landau explains that this soldier was first assigned to the Legio V Macedonica, stationed in Moesia (modern Bulgaria), and was then likely transferred to Cappadocia with his legion before 62 CE with the army of Caesennius Paetus, one of the two armies used in the war against the Parthians. He then seems to have died in Judaea, either during one of the early campaigns in the region or around the time of the siege of Jerusalem.         "

","            This single Palestinian Syriac inscription was found among thirteen other Greek inscriptions in a Byzantine church in Evron, near Nahariya (evro0001 - evro0013). Two other Palestinian Syriac inscriptions have been discovered in nearby Shelomi and Kabri. These churches, as well as the church at Umm el-Ru'us in Judea, offer some of the earliest known Palestinian Syriac material. The church in Evron was constructed in three stages, the first in the 415 CE, the second between 442 and 443 CE, and the third in 490 CE. The author dates this inscription to 415 CE according to a Greek inscription in the same room. The mosaic is comprised of three main elements: (1) a central Greek cross within a circle, (2) four personal names located above and below this circle, and (3) a dark red tesselated frame. The mosaic is very well-preserved, lacking only one tessera. The circle and cross-bars are composed of white, yellow, and gray tessera. A single large, round green glass tessera appears at the center of the cross. Central white lines of tessera trace the lines of the circle and cross. The six letters of the Syriac phrase ""Let them live/be saved"" are written clockwise between the four quadrants created by the cross-bars within the circle. Outside of the circle, two names appear above and below this central motif. Above the circle, the name Claudius/Claudia appears adjacent to the outer frame, and the name Susanna appears between Claudius/Claudia and the central circle. Below the circle, the name Nehemiah/Ναυειμαν/Νεεμειων appears adjacent to the outer frame, and the Safaitic name Boselos appears between Nehemiah and the central circle. Concerning the verb written within the circle, the author points out that the appearance of a final nun is odd. He posits that its usage is primarily decorative, attempting to draw the four letters of the circle's upper two quadrants symmetrically. For instance, the round taw and small initial iudh in the first quadrant are similar in appearance to the round waw and final nun in the quadrant to the left. A similar phenomenon occurs in the writing of Susanna, a well-attested Syriac name. The name Claudius/Claudia seems to be an abbreviated version of the Latin name, making the gender unclear. The name adjacent to the lower edge of the frame is less clear than the others. Depending on the reading of a letter as iudh or nun, it can be a either Syriac rendering of the Hebrew name Nehemiah or a Semitic name elsewhere attested in Greek as Ναυειμαν or Νεεμειων. The fourth name is unattested in Western Aramaic but does appear in the Safaitic area with the Greek transcription Βοσελος.         "

There is damage on the edges of the bottom half of the inscription which renders the last line illegible. The editor records the first line of the inscription as ""_F _F _F"" Μ, and indicates that each of these ""_F"" shapes represents the archaic Hebrew ""yod"". He suggests that these characters are used as a reference to God, and that many example of Yods appearing singly or as groups of up to four exist in the form of incantation texts and Jewish and Gnostic amulets. Finally, he indicates that these characters therefore do not refer to the Trinity as was recorded immediately after the texts excavation. The name Timotheos is of Greek origin.         "

These fragments probably                used to hang above the entrance on the western wall of the main chamber. The first line is a well-known pagan formula                commonly used in the opening line of burial inscriptions. The letters of the second line that still survive likely represent                either 'fathers' or 'daughters' in the nominative case. Leah di Segni suggests that the inscription's placement in what                seems to be a family vault indicates that the inscriptions refers to 'forefathers'. The epithet εὐεργέτης was used as an                honorary title for men in positions of authority and as a complimentary way to address a superior. An example of this is                Luke 22:25 - ""Those in authority over them [i.e. the Gentiles] are called benefactors"".         "

In particular, if the person came from Emaus, he should have been                    designeted as ὁ Ἐμαεῦς. Also, even though the evidence from the NT (see Luke                    24:13) is not far-removed from the spelling we find here, in the late                    Roman-Byzantine period Emmaus was known as Nicopolis. Nevertheless, if we                    consider that the inscription was probably jewish, this may explain the use of                    the old Semitic name, and the linguistic errors may derive from the fact that                    the person who executed it was not well versed in Greek.

Shalom is apparently the daughter of Jehohanan, whose name was inscribed on the ossuary from loculus I. The name Shalom corresponds with the Greek name Σαλωμη and is an abbreviation of the name שלמציון. Sometimes the name Shalom is found with a nun as a last letter, making it שלון. On the right of the inscription on the narrow side there are four letters which could be read as וינה. The last letter could also be a ח instead of a ה. This inscription was engraved by a different hand than the main inscription. The grouping of these four letters does not make sense, so the author says that they were copied from the name Yehohanan by an illiterate person.

These holes seem intended for closure, perhaps with iron rivets. No such rivets were found here; perhaps the holes were never used or rope was used for closure and has since disintegrated. Ornamentation on the chest's front side consists of two metopes in zigzag frames, a row of ashlar- (or metope-?) patterned frieze above base, and a broadened triglyph containing a panelled, two-leaved door(?).

Ornamentation on the chest's left side is similar; a zigzag frame contains a six-petalled rosette within concentric line circles. The name appears once each on the chest's front, back, and left sides; the latter inscription is partially covered by incrustation. מריה is a contracted, Graecized form of מרים. Hachlili regards ברית as a diminutive of ברת; considering that it is otherwise unattested and the usual form appears twice on this ossuary, it seems more likely that the yod was a mistake. נתאל is probably a contraction of the name נתנאל, which is common in Biblical literature and has also been documented in the first century BCE. Hachlili suggests that שלמשן is a contraction of שלמשיון, a local pronunciation of שלמציון, but Naveh notes the difference in the two letters shin and speculates that the second is actually a ligature of ṣadeh and yod, producing שלמצין. Grandparents are infrequently mentioned in ossuary inscriptions; this one is especially rare in listing three generations of women (rather than bearing the name of the deceased and that of her father and grandfather). Mistakes are sometimes made in inscribing בת for בר, but even if that were the case here, the inscription would constitute the only instance of a deceased person's father being identified by his matronymic.

On the chest's left side is a faintly incised six-petalled rosette within concentric line circles; the same ornamentation on the right side is unfinished, and one petal is chip-carved. It is probably the poorly executed attempt of a local artisan. Inscription is written in ink, on the upper left and right of the chest's back side, with exceptional care; Di Segni notes that the small marks shaped like checks, represented in this transcription as soft hyphens, usually appear between words for added elegance. Hachlili concluded that the inscription refers to Queen Agrippina the Younger (15-59 CE) whose freedman, Theodotos, probably lived for some time in Rome but was buried in what was likely his family tomb at Jericho.

The plene form is not recorded at all in Talmudic literature and the contraction appears only once. Hachlili discusses some parallels for Ἰσμάηλος (see bibliography); additionally, the name occurs in second to first century BCE Egypt, in the Dead Sea documents, in priestly and rabbinic families of Jerusalem, commonly, as the name of two first century BCE high priests, and elsewhere, including on two ossuaries.

Five metopes in zigzag frames are on the chest's back side, and the lid has a zigzag frame with a zigzag line along the length of the apex. Inscription is superimposed on the chest's front side. A pottery bowl found nearby bears the name ""Yishma'el, son of Shim'on, son of Palta, (from) Jerusalem""; perhaps it refers to this Shim'on. Age of the deceased is rarely found on ossuaries; on this one and another from Jericho the sign L, standing for ἐτῶν, is used to signal age (see inscription ""jeri0003""). Locally, the sign was used to indicate dates at Maresha and later on coins of the Herodian dynasty and the Roman procurators. It occurs in Jewish tomb inscriptions in Egypt and Cyrenaica, and its use on ossuaries from Israel/Palestine may indicate the scribe's foreign origin.         "

Σαλώμη is one of many forms of the female name שלומציון. The spelling Ἰωέζρος is consistent throughout the tomb group, with the exception of two instances of Ἰοέζρος; both differ considerably from spellings Ἰωζάαρ and Ἰωζάρα in the Septuagint and Ἰώζαρος, Ἰόζαρος and Ἰωάζαρος in Josephus, but all represent יועזר, a contraction of יהועזר. The plene form is not recorded at all in Talmudic literature and the contraction appears only once. Hachlili discusses some parallels for Ἰσμάηλος (see bibliography); additionally, the name occurs in second to first century BCE Egypt, in the Dead Sea documents, in priestly and rabbinic families of Jerusalem, commonly, as the name of two first century BCE high priests, and elsewhere, including on two ossuaries. Γολιάθ is the form in the Septuagint, inflected in Josephus as Γολίαθος. Two men in this family bore the name, which has negative connotations among Jews; such derogatory nicknames, often alluding to a physical characteristic, may have originated as terms of abuse but become accepted family names.

The former interpretation seems more plausible -- the name Abinah/Abunah is attested in Talmudic literature, but during a much later period (200 CE and after) than that of this ossuary; and other inscriptions which describe the joint burial of parent and child contain a conjunctive vav between names, i.e. ""Aha and Ya'aqov, his son.""

The form ישוע, familiar from the later books of the Bible and from the Talmud, is a contraction of the name יהושע, as is ישו. The appearance of the latter here indicates that it did not carry a negative connotation due to its association with Jesus of Nazareth.         "

Assuming transposition of the fifth and sixth characters, with the sixth read as yod, Vincent, Lugscheider, Clermont-Ganneau and Kautzsch read סרי חסיה or מר יחסיה and Klein reads מר חסיה. Rahmani suggests either מרי חוסה, ""my lord Hosah"" (the name is attested in the Bible as that of a Levitic family in Davidic times), or מר יחוסה, ""Master Iahosa,"" Iahosa being a form of Ἰάχος in the pattern of אוכלוסא for ὄχλος (Gen. Rabbah 6:4; Num. Rabbah 6:9) and כרכסא for ϰέρϰος (Esth. Rabbah to 1:10). Inclusion of the engraver's relationship to the deceased, as in ""master"" here, is attested in other inscriptions, e.g. אבונה, ""our father,"" and [אמנ[ה, ""our mother.""         "

The nickname, like the similar בן כנבון, ""son of 'round cake,'"" would indicate obesity, or a personal trait such as greediness or predilection for this food. These derogatory nicknames and others such as ""the dour"" and ""son of 'soft cheese'"" may have originated as terms of abuse but become accepted family names.

There are six separate phrases inscribed on the ossuary, all nearly identical except for one that says only Πρώτατ[ος]. The latter appears inside the ossuary, on the chest's back side, inverted. A second phrase also appears inverted and on the inside, on the right side. This occurs elsewhere, and was perhaps the easiest way to write inside the chest; it is possible that these were inscribed after the remains of the deceased were placed in the ossuary. The remaining phrases appear vertically ascending in the left-most intercolumnar space of the chest's front, beneath the rim on the back and left sides, and at the base on the left side. Two -- those appearing on the chest's front and on the inner right side -- have disappeared almost completely since Bagatti and Milik first documented them. Repetition of the name of the deceased may express grief of the mourner(s) or improve upon an unsatisfactory first inscription. Δωσώ is the contracted form of a name cognate to Dosithea, paralleling the contemporary contraction of the male name דוסא or דוסאי as Δωση. Πρωτᾶς also appears among Jews in Italy and Egypt. The word Τειμεισείων seems to stand for Τιμισίων, ""honored in Zion,"" perhaps a compound of τίμιος, ""valued, honored, worthy, noble,"" with Ζιών, ""Zion.""

One belongs to an older man, who could be the father of שלום mentioned here, and the second belongs to a young man who might be his son. (Such cases are attested.)

Ἱωνᾶς occurs in an Egyptian document of 219-8 BCE, where the text's editors consider it ""probably an abbreviation of Ἰωνάτας יהונתן rather than a transcription of the rare name יונה"" (Tcherikover and Fuks, Corpus Papyronum Judaicarum I:181). A second ossuary purchased at the same time as this one, very similar in style, form and decoration and probably originating from the same tomb, belongs to a man with this name. (See inscription ""jeru0101."") It is likely, then, that Iona is a contracted name referring to him. If so, the use of differing contractions of the name in Greek and in Hebrew is noteworthy.

Alternatively, it may be like those marks used in lieu of names as mentioned in the Babylonian Talmud in the first half of the third century CE, where a fish is specifically noted as the mark of Rav. Engemann suggests that on sepulchral monuments too a fish might allude to the name of occupation of the deceased (Reallexikon fur Antike und Christentum, s.v. ""Fisch"").

Ornamentation, on the chest's front side, consists of two metopes in zigzag frames, doubled at top, and a broadened and bare triglyph. Each metope contains a six-petalled rosette within a zigzag circle. The inscription, written in charcoal and partially obliterated by incrustation, appears inside the chest, on its back side, inverted. This occurs elsewhere, and was perhaps the easiest way to write inside the chest; it is possible that these were inscribed after the remains of the deceased were placed in the ossuary. עטוף may stand for ""wrapped"" or ""covered,"" referring to the sheet covering the bones of the deceased, though the wording in Semahot is actually פירס עליהן, ""spread over them"" (12:9). Alternatively, the word might be a descriptor of the deceased, meaning ""feeble"" or ""faint"" and usually referring to one in dire distress; the meaning was still current in the fourth century CE. This would resemble the Giv'at Hamivtar inscription where the words מעניה מרדפה, ""the oppressed, the persecuted,"" accompany Abba's name. It is unlikely that the word expresses grief of the mourner(s), as such expressions are absent in contemporary local Jewish ossuary and tomb inscriptions, with the exception of the occasional חבל.

That phrase appears on the chest's lid, while the name Yehuda appears twice on the chest's right side, written in two different Jewish scripts. It may refer to the later interment of an infant son to the ossuary -- in which case the repetition of his name may express grief of the mourner(s), or improve upon an unsatisfactory first inscription -- or it may be the name of the son who collected his mother's remains.

The first two words appear above the right-hand rosette; the latter two on the chest's right side. The reading of שלם חננ is uncertain, as both the shin and lamed and the mem and heth seem to be ligatures. If this reading is accepted, the first word is unlikely to be the word meaning ""peace,"" which we would expect after the name of the deceased, not before. It is more likely the female name contracted from שלמציון or the male name Shallum. Kloner cites the term דבידודי here, which refers to a member of an uncle's household, but it is attested in third to fourth century CE Babylonia and thus remote in period and location from this ossuary. An alternative interpretation of the phrase on the ossuary's right side suggests that the deceased was of Davidic ancestry; such claims were made for Hillel the Elder, for example, and the several names of this tomb associated with the royal house of David (Avshalom, Hanan, and perhaps Shallum) support the view that certain families in the city claimed Davidic descent. No clues can be gleaned from the tomb's facade, as it was bulldozed prior to excavation. (See source for a greater discussion of this opinion.)         "

Its size is remarkable but not unique; probably Phasael's body was placed in this receptable and the remains of his wife and son added later. Dimensions in parentheses include cornice; height describes that of chest plus that of gabed lid with deep wedge on length of apex. Ornamentation is elaborate. On the chest's front side, it consists of a zigzag frame on left, right, and bottom, with sides of the frame continued onto feet, and a central row and seven horizontal, somewhat irregularly spaced rosettes of 15, 16 or 17 petals. The back side is similar, but without the frame. Left and right sides have the frame, containing one grooved ring carved in high relief, encircling an eight-petalled rosette with petals shaped as inward-pointing ivy leaves. Ornamentation on the lid's front and back sides consists of a zigzag frame with an ashlar patterned frieze at the base and a central row of five horizontal rosettes, each row flanked by rings and rosettes like those of the chest's left and right sides. These rings on the lid seem to derive from representations of knocker or handle rings lacking indications of attachments. On either of the lid's gables sits a large eight-petalled rosette within a zigzag circle, above a large fingergrip. The first word is deeply carved on the lid, under the row of rosettes; the next name appears finely incised to the right of it, mostly in doubled lines; and the last finely incised to its left, partially in doubled lines. The name Φασάηλος is well known from Herod's family, but not elsewhere attested locally on a Jewish inscription. The name is found in many Palmyrene, Safaitic, and especially Nabataean inscriptions from the first and second centuries CE in both male (as here) and female forms. Perhaps the deceased was a Palmyrene or Nabataean who married into a Jewish family. The father and son of this ossuary bear the same name; this is attested elsewhere in the area. The woman's name, meaning ""strong born, mighty,"" is a variant of Ἰφιγένεια, which does not occur in early epigraphy (save for a possible reading in a second century CE inscription at Ephesus), and which has strong pagan connotations, perhaps unknown to the deceased or not considered; in Greek mythology Agamemnon's daughter of that name was identified with goddesses Artemis and Hecate, and a cult image of Artemis-Iphigenia still stood in Syria in the mid-second century CE. The names of the wife and son seem to have been incised by the same hand; perhaps they died at the same time.         "

Ornamentation on the chest's front side consists of a porch with three rectangular columns, each with a vertically superimposed multi-leaved branch. Each intercolumnar space contains a twelve-petalled rosette with ivy-shaped petals within a line circle. Ivy leaves point toward circles from each corner of intercolumnar spaces.

The former bears the names ""Maris and Shim'on, sons of Sha'ul,"" perhaps referring to the same Maris.         "

Similar examples, however, do occur on an ossuary from ""Dominus Flevit,"" in the phrase אבי שלום אבא יהוחנן, and later at Bet She'arim.

It is unlikely that this is a derogatory nickname similar to those found in Talmudic literature, deriving either from עגול, meaning ""round"" and implying ""paunchy,"" or from העגל, ""the calf,"" which occurs later in the Cairo Geniza. This instance may have been influenced by the Palmyrene name. Naveh offers a discussion of such ""nameless people"" as this and similar ר' יוחנן בן תורתא, ""R.

A circle surrounds the inscription on the lid's back side. In 1931, Maisler recorded nearly the same name inscribed beside the tree, שלמצי בת שמי; it has since worn away. שלמצין is one of many variants of the female name שלומצוין.

In style and               execution, the grapes resemble those on local tomb facades and sarcophagi. On the               chest's front side, a sunken panel within a profiled frame contains a composite               central motif, perhaps an acanthus or olive branches with their fruit. The motif is               flanked by grape clusters, each a large cluster with a smaller one to either side;               those to the left of the motif have round berries and those to the right have               elongated ones. Small five- and six-petalled rosettes are suspended from the smaller               clusters.

On the chest's right side, a sunken panel within a profiled frame               contains a six-petalled rosette within an egg-and-tongue circle with a four-petalled               bud at its center and ivy leaves pointing inward between its petals. On the chest's               back side, a raised rectangular panel represents a single ashlar.

The author may have been named                         Gabriel, as suggested by the phrase ""I Gabriel"" in line 77. The                         ""messenger/angel Michael"" also appears in Daniel 10:13 and in the New                         Testament (Revelation 12:7 and Jude 9), and appears in conjunction with                         Gabriel in extra-Biblical sources like Enoch and the War Scroll (1QM).                         Mention of ""my servant David,"" ""David the servant of Yahweh,"" and Jerusalem                         suggest the author's support of the Davidic dynasty; in fact, the text as a                         whole may be apocalyptic, representing the views of one side of a debate                         between messianic groups. As in the Bible, this text uses the name Yahweh,                         and opens many of its prophecies with ""Thus (or therefore) said the Lord                         [that is, Yahweh and sometimes the more generic Elohim] of hosts."" The name                         ""Elohei Yisrael,"" ""God of Israel,"" and mention of Yahweh's ""kavod"", or                         glory, also appear in both. Other familiar phrases are ""[God] shows mercy                         to thousands"" (line 74) found in Exodus 20:6, Deuteronomy 5:10, and                         Jeremiah 32:18, and ""And I will shake the heaven and the earth"" (lines                         24-25), from the prophet Haggai 2:6, as well as others familiar from                         Biblical prophets Zechariah and Daniel. The stone's inscribed side is                         polished, but the back side is not, suggesting that it once hung on a wall.                         One break in the stone separates the bottom five or so lines from the rest;                         a second break cuts off a fragment containing about four lines of text from                         the right-hand column. It is badly preserved with lacunae all over it.                         Shape and form of the letters date the inscription, which is verified by                         the post-Biblical, pre-Mishnaic Hebrew. The script looks careless but is                         the work of a professional scribe; perhaps it just proved difficult to                         write in ink on stone. The text appears in two columns read top-to-bottom,                         44 lines in the right-hand column and 43 on the left. Like the Dead Sea                         Scrolls, the stone has guidelines incised with a thin, sharp instrument:                         horizontal ones that cross the column divide, with the letters suspended                         from the upper guideline, and vertical ones, one each at the left and right                         of both columns. In the translation provided here, capital letters                         represent Semitic sounds. The words ""this bad,"" appearing in line 21 of the                         translation, are actually in line 22 of the Hebrew text, coincidentally                         separated by a line break because in Hebrew word order an adjective follows                         its noun. The unclear פ in line 16 might be a מ. The unclear ו in line 22                         might be a י. The letters ד/ר/ך in line 22 are possible readings of a                         single character, as are the letters ב/מ in line 37, ד/ר in lines 51 and                         52, ו/י in line 53, and ה/ח in line 64.

This altar, however, is dedicated to Tyche (Τύχη), likely at the behest of the δεκάδαρχος; the editor notes that it cannot be taken as evidence of a Τύχη cult at Cadasa. (A reading of Τυρίων instead of Τύχης is rendered unlikely by the altar's modest size.) The title δεκάδαρχος may refer to a civilian municipal position, a position in a collegium as a council member, or the position of a cavalry officer in the military. It is identical with the Roman title ""decurio."" The date 340 provided in the inscription is according Tyrian era as in the other inscriptions found at this site, and therefore corresponds to 214/215 CE (during the reign of Caracalla).The editor notes that the first line of the inscription is carved on the projection of the cornice, clearly separated from the other lines. He suggests that this indicates the importance of the person whose name it records, and offers the emperor Caracalla; a dedicatory inscription from Bulgaria also refers to him this way, as he traced his descent from the Antonines and used their name.

The dates proposed for the inscription are based on               the Tyrian era, which began in 126/125 BCE. A reading of IYE as (L)YE could indicate               ""in the year 405"", that is 279/280 CE. By instead reading LY and taking the Ε as an               abbreviation for the word ἔτους, the date would be the year 410 of the Tyrian era,               that is 284/285 CE. The author notes that both readings are based on the opinion of               Clermont-Ganneau and that the date is therefore uncertain. Artemisios is the eighth               month of the Macedonian calendar and corresponds to May 19 - June 18, indicating a               date of June 5.         "

The inscription's reference ""holy god of the sky"" is also believed to refer to Baalshamin. This inscription appears over 7 lines with an average of fifteen letters per line. The date 243 is likely according to the Tyrian era, thus indicating 117/118 CE. The word εὐχήν is an abbreviated formula of κατ' εὐχήν, a commonly met phrase which indicates ""in fulfillment of a vow"". Fisher, Ovadiah and Roll take the names Annios, Lisemseos and Damas to be Greek, and Nagda to be semetic in origin. Adam Łajtar, on the other hand, holds that Lisemseos is also of Semitic origin. The author notes the proper spelling of συνγένια to be συνγένεια and suggests that it identifies a relationship between the god and the worshippers. The inscription was moved in 1923 to Beirut.         "

The title of hegumen which the priest Theodorus bore suggests that there was also a               monastery in this location. The meanings of two words in the inscription are noted to               be unclear: πέπμα and προσθήκα. The first, it seems, refers to the back wall of the               sanctuary. This wall seems to have been partly faced with marble and, as the editor               points out, partly painted with figures (ζωγραφία). She indicates that προσθήκη is a               difficult term to deal with, suggesting that it ought to be understood as ""addition""               in this context, though to what exactly it refers is unclear. Di Sengi dismisses the               idea that is refers to an apse, instead proposing that it refers to a nave. She               concludes this based upon other its context, other attestations of the word and               Lampe's lexicon of Patristic Greek. The issue is further clouded, however, by the               only partial nature of the excavation of this site. The dates 563/564 CE, 578/579 CE,               593/594 CE, and 608/609 CE all took place during a twelfth indication and are thus               all possible, though the author favors the two latest options as the most likely. The               inscription makes use of lunate sigmas and large miniscule omega's rather than their               majuscule equivalent.         "

","            The temple at Cadasa (Tel Qedesh) appears to be dedicated to the god Baalshamin based on epigraphical evidence and two carved images of eagles found at the site. This inscription was carved on a high pedestal which was intended to hold a statue. The first line has only two letters remaining, both of which are illegible, but it probably contained some kind of blessing in honor or memory of the persons named, who are donors and possibly all related. The seventh and eighth lines have smaller letters (1.6-2.2 cm as opposed to 3 cm) which are more closely spaced, which the author attributes to a miscalculation of space. He suggests that the pedestal likely supported a statue of a diety such as Baalshamin, the emperor, or a prominent family member of those who donated the statue. Κράτηρος is a phonetic misspelling of Κράτερος or Κρατερός, and Ἀήλιας is probably a corruption of Ἀέλιος, the Greek form of Latin Aelius. Ἀντικέρασoς, Κράτηρος and Ἀγαθοκλῆς are common in the Greek onomastikon. The date 315 is likely to be according to the Tyrian era, thus indicating 189/190 CE (under the reign of Commodus). Adam Łajtar provides a different restoration of the text, resulting in a translation of ""[name,...]-eus Antikerasos Krateros (erected) the statue of his wife Aureila Agathoclea and his daughter Ioulitta together with its pedestal, in the year 315.""

Dauphin thinks that the form of the letters suggests a sixth century date. The possible dates given all fell within the 12th year indiction. The inscription does not describe the type of structure the mosaic was laid in. The western end of the structure is destroyed, so its original dimensions are also unknown. Daupin suggests that because the mosaic must be read facing the east, the room might have had an eastern orientation. He also comments that the site might have been a monastic complex.

","            Floor mosaic, inscription complete. Inscription is of five lines of square script on a white background, underlined by yellowish lines and set within a black rectangular frame. It was first published by V. Tzaferis and S. Bar-Lev, and is presented in Gregg using their transcription and translation. The designation within the inscription of the cleric Thomas as both presbyter and superior points to the likelihood that the Khisfin church was part of a monastic complex. For ευ'χαριστῶν in line 4, Gregg suggests an alternate translation of ""giving thanks."" Tzaferis and Bar-Lev fix the date of the dedication at 618 CE, which corresponds both with a dating by the Syrian era (49 CE) and the seventh year of an indication. They reason that this date fits in with the Persian invasions of 614 CE, which may have caused damage to the church and necessitated its renovation. Gregg, however, suggests that Khisfin might have used the Pompeian secular era, which would yield a date of 604 CE. This was the seventh year of an indiction, while 618 CE was actually the sixth.         "

Daniel rebuilt it.				         ,"            Broken lintel, inscription incomplete. The initial line is broken horizontally through the middle of the letters, and does not afford a clear reading. This reconstruction is quite tentative. The title δεοπότης, deisgnating a ruler or local magistrate as ""Lord,"" may stand in abbreviated form here. Only two or at most three letters formed the beginning of the name with the ending -ηθων, and the first letters of ἔκτισεν are thought to follow, interrupted by a breakage along the top of the stone. If this reading is correct, the inscription framed by the two crosses on the left is complete, and once gave the name of the person who erected the building. Though the first segment of line 2 could be rendered παῤ οἰκίᾳ ἰδίᾳ, ""next to his own house,"" the word παροικία bears the sense of ""congregation"" or ""church community"" in Christian writings beginning in the second century, and by the fourth century can indicate an ecclesiastical province. The inscription shows a clear abbreviation mark after the letters ΚΑΘ, and it seems to reasonable to assume that the word καθολικῆς is intended. The phrase ""catholic church"" may signify simply the jurisdiction of a bishop, but it could be a claim made against another group of Christians regarded as un-catholic. Many inscriptions from Syria have been seen to reflect conflict stemming from the Council of Chalcedon with orthodox Christians against monophysite/Jacobite Christians. Inscription originally published by Schumacher, but inspection of the stone and its photograph allows for correction of Schumacher's reading. The first letters of Daniel's name do not appear on the left side of the stone, but must be supplied for the two damaged spaces on the right half of the stone. It appears that there are two separate inscriptions on this lintel, and the name of Daniel cannot plausibly be linked with the phrases on its left side, which would render Daniel the church community's ""catholicus,"" or patriarch.

On several                    other ostraka, names are followed by epithets; 2) a topographical or directional                    indication, although if this were true one would expect a -מ or -מן to indicate                    'from'; 3) a product of good or superior quality: the form מעליא means 'of good                    quality' in Babylonian Aramaic. However, this interpretation is problematic, as                    we would expect this term to follow the product, whereas here it follows the                    proper name.            "

This                    line might be part of the date formula, sometimes found in the first line of such                    inscriptions. If so, the only possible candidate for this year would be                    Artaxerxes II, who reigned from 404 to 359/8 BCE: hence the ostrakon would refer                    to 363 BCE. It is also possible that more units followed the number 41, in which                    case more years should be added to the regnal year. Another probable explanation                    is that the bet indicates something else, such as goods or products. In an                    ostrakon published by Eph'al and Naveh, however, the bet ""does not seem to stand                    for a measure of unit"".            "

The text apparently opens with                    an abbreviated date, 'on the tenth', which might designate either the day of                    month X, or the year 10. It is then followed by a list of names and products,                    followed by numbers. Line 1: what follows the ב could be identified as a                    sign referring to the numbers 10 or 20, probably a shorte date formula. Another                    possible reading is the letter kaph followed by a peh. זידא is a Nabatean name.                    One might read a resh instead of the dalet.Line 2: כנבון is a name found at                    Masada. This epithet derives from כבונא, ""round loaf"" or ""a round cake"". Thus                    כנבון was likely the appellation of a fat person. The name כנבו is known also                    from an Aramaic seal. Tal Ilan suggests an association with the Babylonian god                    נבו.Line 3: The second letter of the first word might be a waw. A possible                    reading is קדרין. The word קדר is mentioned as a profession on an ossuary found                    at Giv'at Ha-Mivtar, and thus it may be interpreted here as 'the potters' (with                    the Aramic plural suffix). Another possible interpretation is Qedarites. The                    earliest reference ot the Qedarites occurs on an eighth century BCE stele of                    Tiglath-Pileser III from Iran, on which leaders from the western part of                    Mesopotamia are listed. During the eighth and seventh centuries BCE, their                    territory stretched eastward from the wester border of Babylon. In the seventh                    century BCE, they invaded Transjordan and southern Syria, and were among the                    nomadic groups that put pressure on the settled area from the Jebel Bishri                    region to the outskirts of Damascus. A fifth-century BCE Aramaic inscription                    written on a silver vessel from Tell el-Maskhute mentions the name Qedar זי קינו                    בר גשם מלך קדר קרב להנאלת, 'that which Qainu son of Gesem king of Qedar, brought                    in offering to Han-'Ilat'. Herodotus reports that they dwelt in northern Sinai                    near the eastern border of Egypt, and were ""perhaps engaged in keeping that                    border secure for the Achaemenid authorities. The word קסיה is hitherto unknown.                    It can either be interpreted as a name, or as a metathesis of קיסה meaning                    ""pole"" or ""wood.""Line 4: The pe might also be read as a bet. Another                    possible reading is בר צפון, meaning inhabitant of the north or son of ṢPWN. If                    we read read inhabitant of the north, it can be compared with Hananiah's epithet                    נותוס, written in a text from Qumran. It is also similar to Shimeon son of Notos                    from Masada, where Notos means inhabitant of the north. It can also be compared                    with the epithet בר דרומא, inhabitant of th south.Line 5: One tentative                    reading is ערבין, Arabs sometimes mentioned with Qedar קדר ערב ובל נשיאי ,                    Arabia and all Qedar's chiefs. When the Kingdom of Judah was destroyed and the                    Edomite kingdom that ruled southern Transjordan and the eastern Negev collapsed                    in the first third of the sixth century BCE, the Arabs were among the nomads                    that penetrated the territory of Palestine, and continued to do so throughout                    the sixth and fifth centuries.

However, as the affairs in Koile                    Syria and Phoinike lack someone in charge for the care of these things, we                    thought that Olympiodoros will preside prudently over the orderly conduct of                    associations (?), [he, who] has demonstrated his loyalty to us because of his                    attitude, from times gone by, as he had been raised with us and had gained                    for himself the best disposition in all things, he was, on the one hand,                    appointed chamberlain with reason, because he has proved himself worthy due to                    his long-standing loyalty, while on the other, he was justifiably introduced                    into the (ranks of the) First Friends because of his love for us, having made                    the most assiduous demonstrations (of loyalty) while in such a [rank], and                    following the way that we are inclined to [increase] the honour of the gods in                    accordance with the [attitude] of our ancestors and the care of the temples in                    which we believed from [times gone by …] … .            ","                This translation and transcription is taken from the postscript as it reflects                    the most updated view of the author.                    This stele is comprised of two letters                    which can both be dated to the month of Gorpiaios in 178 BCE.                    This                    correspondence in its restored state sheds a light on the political rise of one                    Olympiodoros as he attains a high priest hood. This stele is the first evidence                    epigraphical or otherwise for the presence of the class of ""First Friends"" in                    the Seleucid Court, which Olympiodoros was evidently a part of. The presence of                    one of these honorary titles in 186, early within th ereign of Seleucus IV,                    argues for the establishing of the system either in the very beginning of his                    reign, or else during the later part of the rule of his father.                    This text                    also offers some clarity on the governorship of Koile Syria and Phoinike. This                    stele suggests that Dorymenes was the successor of Apollonius son of Thraseas                    and the predessor of Apollonios son of Menestheus.                    Dorymenes is referred to                    as ""brother"" by Heliodoros, making this the only example of a Seleucid official                    referring to another member of the administration as ""brother"".                     The                    spelling ΘΕΩΥΝ is an example of the engraver's carelessness. It could be causeed                    that the king in his letter took into account the beliefs of the Jews and                    Samaritans and the declaration was supposed to be published as τοῦ θεοῦ                    instead.                    The final line instead of reading προς τῆς could instead be read as                    προςστήσεαι            "

This fragmentary segment is clearly a                    letter of a public nature.
